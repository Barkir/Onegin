(critical judges, strict as any)
A man who's active and incisive
After a fine career, his father
Alas, on pleasure's wild variety
Along the fronts of darkened houses,
And Eugene? half-awake, half-drowsing,
And the sly baseness, fit to throttle,
And what's more, they're so supercilious,
Another page of recollection:
Applause. Onegin enters -- passes
At first Onegin's tongue produced
But God, how deadly dull to sample
But was it happy, his employment,
But when the hour of youthful passion
But you, blest husbands, to the end
But, did they not corrupt society,
But, now 've praised the queens of fashion,
Capricious belles of grand Society!

Dressed like -- --,14 duly dreading
Enchanted land! There like a lampion
Escaped from social rhyme and reason,
Eugene as clever, and quite sweet.
Eugene attends the boulevard,
Eugene was free, and as a dresser
Eugene's a pedant in his dress,
Evgeny's total store of knowledge
Exhausted by the ballroom's clamour,
Fate saved Evgeny from perdition:
Faublas'3 disciple for an age --
Fonvizin8 sparkled, freedom's champion,
Friends of my Ruslan and Lyudmila,
He cursed Theocritus and Homer,
He gave three balls a year, and rather
He lacked the slightest predilection
He mounts the sledge, with daylight fading:
He was sweet-natured, and yet wild.
He was without that dithyrambic
He who has lived and thought is certain
He'd given up girls -- now gave up letters,
He's flown to Talon's,4 calculating
He's off -- this ruthless legislator
His father failed to understand
His hair was fashionably curled,
How early he'd learnt to dissemble,
How early on he learnt to trouble
How soft his glance, or at discretion
How well he donned new shapes and sizes --
Let others learn from his example!
Meanwhile, attired for morning strolling
Monsieur l'Abbé, the mediocre,
More wine, he calls, to drench the flaming
My goddesses! Where are you banished?
My love for it is just as tender,
No moralizing from this joker;
No, early on his heart was cooling
No, never in the hottest fire
Now Latin's gone quite out of favour;
Nursed in the orient's languid weakness,
Oh, when, and to what desert banished,
On the seashore, with storm impending,
Onegin has outrun us all.
Onegin knew enough to savour
Onegin was assessed by many
Onegin, my good friend, was littered
Parisian taste invents for one --
Porcelain and bronzes on the table,
Prince Vyazemsky
Rousseau (forgive a short distraction)
Russia's Terpsichore, shall never
Shall  depict with expert knowledge
So, like Childe Harold, glum, unpleasing,
Some days he's still in bed, and drowses,
Still in the porch, exhausted-stupid,
Still tumbling, devil, snake and Cupid
Such were a young rake's meditations --
That isn't our immediate worry:
The World found this enough to treat
The bitterness was mine -- the ice
The city's early sounds awake her;
The happiness of youth is dead,
The house is packed out; scintillating,
The illness with which he'd been smitten
Then with a half-ethereal splendour,
Then, after midday he'll be waking;
There once  too strolled back and forth:
Three whole hours, at the least accounting,
To live, it hurries, and to feel it hastes.
